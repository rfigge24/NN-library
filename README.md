# Neural Network library
I started this free-time project to get a feeling for the deeplearning fundamentals and maths. 
This project is based on the tutorials of ["The Independent Code"](https://www.youtube.com/@independentcode/videos). 
I have updated the whole project to support batch input, mini-batch gradient descent and many activation functions.

## includes:
A Keras sequential like api, that is suitable for batch learning. 
2 demo projects that use the api:
- An XOR function
- An interactive color prefrence learning model:
  - This project was adviced by [Jabrils](https://www.youtube.com/@Jabrils). Props to him for making me interested in AI and deeplearning!

### supported activation functions:
- Binary Step
- ELU
- Leaky ReLU
- ReLU
